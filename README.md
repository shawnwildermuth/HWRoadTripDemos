# Hello World Road Trip Demos
In case you haven't heard, I'm on the road this spring doing ASP.NET Core talks and 
live interviews for my podcast [(Hello World Podcast)](http://hwpod.com)! 

Instead of having a repo per stop, I'm going to put all the demo code for the ASP.NET Core talks here
in this repo. At each stop I'll be introducing ASP.NET Core 1.0 by creating a new project. You can see them all here.
